To use a real database, replace `src/data/db.js` with your database connection (PostgreSQL with Prisma, MongoDB with Mongoose, etc.)

## 🔒 Security

- JWT authentication on all protected routes
- Role-based access control (RBAC) per module
- CORS configured for frontend URL
- Helmet.js for HTTP security headers
